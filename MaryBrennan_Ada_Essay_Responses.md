##### 1. Why do you want join Ada Developers Academy? Why are you interested in programming? Tell us about your journey thus far to learn about and confirm your interest in programming.
Have you ever encountered a technology manager that did not know much about technology?   That is me.  Working as a Business Development Manager for a Seattle printing company, I was tasked with hiring and managing a team of web developers.  While I demonstrated talent for finding good people and managing projects, I was at a disadvantage because my technology skills were lacking.  I have some exposure to HTML, but I do not know how to code and have only a cursory understanding of IT infrastructure.  When accepted into Ada, I want to use the education to enhance my skill set and open doors to more opportunities in programming.


###### 2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years? How do you see yourself impacting the technology field?
Initially, I’d like to work in programming and immerse myself in gaining a strong understanding of coding/logic.  I believe in learning by doing.  In five years, I’d like to get back into technology management.   I have a reputation as being a strong leader and having an innate ability achieve the impossible.  I’m in the latter part of my career. I’d like to spend the rest of my days helping women and men of all ages and walks of life, embrace careers in technology.  

##### 3. Read Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement. How will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?

When I was a little girl, my mother used to recite these lyrics from the musical South Pacific:  

_“You've got to be taught before it's too late, before you are six or seven or eight, to hate all the people your relatives hate, you've got to be carefully taught!”_

I was lucky to have a mother who taught me and my brothers to treat all people with kindness and respect regardless of their nationality, color, creed, gender or financial status.  I took those lessons seriously and am committed to living a life that embraces inclusion and diversity.   I will contribute to Ada’s vision by promoting these values and helping others to the same.   

As a director at my former employer, I led a team of techies.  We were gay, straight, liberal, conservative, white, Afro-American, Asian, men and women.  Some were newly out of college, some were mid-career while others were edging closer to retirement.  I believe our differences brought us closer together.  We worked as a team to accomplish our goals and to support each other in times of need.  

##### 4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake. What did you learn? What would you do differently?
At RR Donnelley, I worked as an estimator for large-scale print projects (>$500,000).  When working on a new estimate, I found that I made a mistake on an existing job that under-valued production time and materials by $30,000. As soon as I discovered the error, I alerted my manager, the pressroom scheduler and the paper buyer.  We had to move other jobs around to find more press time and we needed to purchase additional paper to make sure we could complete the job.  I turned a loss into a win by owning up to my mistake and taking responsibility for my actions.   Moving forward, I made sure to always check my work and to be careful of taking risks late in the day when I might be tired.
